OVN-Kubernetes is an open source, cloud native networking solution for Kubernetes clusters. It provides:

1. Network connectivity for your workloads (pods and VMs) in your cluster
2. Acts as Kubernetes Service Proxy by load balancing traffic destined for your Services to the backend EndpointSlices
3. Implements Kubernetes Network Policies, Admin Network Policies and Baseline Admin Network Policies that can be used to secure your cluster traffic at L3 and L4
4. Implements User Defined Network Segmentation - where users can define Multiple Isolated Networks and put their different types of applications into these networks thus guaranteeing native isolation for your workloads
